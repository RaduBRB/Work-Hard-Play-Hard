In this lab I spent time getting hands‑on with a few Terraform concepts that, at first, felt a bit abstract. Once I worked through them,they started to make a lot more sense, especially in the context of real infrastructure work.
One of the first things I explored was Terraform workspaces. Initially, they were confusing because the lab didn’t explain what they actually do. After experimenting with creating dev, qa, and prod workspaces, I realised that workspaces aren’t magical “environments” they’re simply separate state files. The code stays the same, but each workspace keeps its own state, which means Terraform can create completely separate sets of resources from the same configuration. It helped me understand how Terraform tracks infrastructure and why state isolation matters, even if in real projects I’d probably prefer separate folders over workspaces to avoid cluttering the code with conditionals.
Another key part of the lab was learning how to import existing AWS resources into Terraform. This was something I’d always seen mentioned but never actually tried. The lab provided an S3 bucket that already existed in AWS, and my task was to bring it under Terraform’s control. I learned that Terraform can’t manage a resource unless it’s in the state file, so the import block acts as a bridge between “this thing already exists” and “Terraform should manage it now.” Writing the import block and the matching resource block helped me understand how Terraform maps real infrastructure to code. It also made it clear that importing doesn’t magically pull in everything , if I imported a VPC, for example, Terraform wouldn’t automatically import all the subnets, route tables, or gateways. Each resource has to be imported individually, which is important to know when dealing with existing environments.
Overall, this lab helped me connect a lot of dots. I learned how Terraform separates state, how it handles multiple environments, and how it adopts resources that weren’t created through Terraform in the first place. Even though some parts of the lab felt under‑explained, working through them gave me a much clearer understanding of how Terraform actually behaves behind the scenes, and why these features matter when managing real infrastructure.
